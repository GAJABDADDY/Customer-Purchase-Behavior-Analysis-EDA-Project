# Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Customer Purchase Behavior in Superstore Marketing

## Project Overview
This project focuses on analyzing customer purchase behavior in Superstore Marketing. Using Python in Google Colab, we performed data cleaning, transformation, and applied various techniques of descriptive statistics and probability distributions to gain insights into customer segments, purchasing patterns, and trends.

## Technologies Used
- Python for data cleaning, transformation, descriptive statistics, and probability distributions in Google Colab
- GitHub for version control and collaboration

## Dataset Description
The dataset contains information about customer transactions in Superstore Marketing, including product details, customer demographics, purchase amounts, and timestamps. Data cleaning involved handling missing values, outliers, and standardizing data formats. Data transformation steps included feature engineering, segmentation, and applying statistical techniques.

## Insights Overview
### 1. Descriptive Statistics
- Summary statistics of purchase amounts (mean, median, standard deviation)
- Distribution of purchase amounts by product categories and customer segments
- Frequency analysis of purchase timestamps (daily, monthly, seasonal trends)

### 2. Probability Distributions
- Analysis of purchase amounts using probability distributions (e.g., normal, exponential, gamma)
- Probability density functions and cumulative distribution functions for purchase amounts
- Hypothesis testing for comparing purchase behavior between customer segments

### 3. Customer Segmentation
- Clustering analysis to identify customer segments based on purchase behavior
- Visualization of customer segments using scatter plots, heatmaps, or dendograms
- Insights into high-value customers, loyal customers, and potential target segments

## Visualizations
Visualizations created using Python libraries (e.g., matplotlib, seaborn) in Google Colab:
- Histograms and density plots of purchase amounts
- Box plots and violin plots for comparing purchase behavior across segments
- Scatter plots and heatmaps for visualizing customer clusters

## How to Use
1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
2. Open the Jupyter Notebook file in Google Colab or any compatible environment.
3. Execute the code cells to reproduce the data cleaning, transformation, and analysis process.
4. Explore the visualizations and insights presented in the notebook.

## Future Work
Future enhancements to this project may include:
- Advanced machine learning models for predictive customer segmentation
- Incorporating external data sources for enriched customer profiling
- Real-time monitoring and analysis of customer purchase behavior
